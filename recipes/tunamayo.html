    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>This is a simple yet delicious dish packing a lot of protein that can be made in minutes. No prep time, almost no cooking time and can be topped and served with anything youd like.</p>

    <p>I usually prefer mine with roasted seaweed sheets for a bit of umame flavor server over warm rice</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cans Tuna, whichever you prefer</li>
        <li>105g Light/Low Fat Mayonaisse</li>
        <li>15mL Light Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>6g Furikake Rice Seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Drain the canned tuna and place in a bowl. Depending on the type of tuna you use you will have to smash the tuna into smaller chunks with a fork unless you like bigger pieces</li>
        <li>Add the mayo, soy sauce and furikake and stir. Continue to stir until the darkness from the soy sauce has spread out evenely accross all the tuna</li>
        <li>And you are done, simply serve with whatever else you like and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
