    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't like a plate of classic pancakes, except these are anything but classic. Made with the bodybuilder in mind these pancakes have a great calorie to protein ratio and do not taste like cardboard</p>
    <p>Pair this with a plate of bacon and soft scrambled eggs and you have a great day ahead of you.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <h4>Wet:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>76mL Unsweetened Almond Milk</li>
        <li>1/4 Beat Egg</li>
        <li>4g Butter (or any other fattener)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dry</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>30g All Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>30g Protein Powder (more on this below)</li>
        <li>8g Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>1g Salt</li>
        <li>&lt;1g Baking Soda</li>
        <li>2g Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, a note on the protein powder. The type and brand of protein powder you use will drastically change how good the pancakes taste. Protein powder burns at lower heats unlike flour, experiment with the recipe and tweak your cooking times and heats to get the best outcome. I found the best results using both Vital Performance Vanilla Protein Powder and Gold Standar Vanilla Protein Powder though I found the Vital Performance PP to produce fluffier, tastier pancakes.</li>
        <li>In an oven safe container melt the butter, you can save yourself more dishes if this container can be used agian.</li>
        <li>In a seperate container beat the egg. Pour about 1/4 of the egg into another bowl along with the milk and melted butter. I usually use the leftover egg and 2 others to make scrambled eggs.</li>
        <li>In another, bigger bowl, wisk the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Once everything is nice and incorporated, mix the wet into the dry and wisk some more until a nice consistency is formed.</li>
        <li>Prepare a skillet over medium low heat (the heat you use will vary depending on the burning point of your protein powder which you will find through trial and error) optionally use cooking spray or more butter depending on your fitness goals.</li>
        <li>Cook the pancake until both sides are a nice golden brown and they have risen. Serve with syrup and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
